 * 
 * Purpose:
 *    Map a list of values against an associative array to become object properties.
 * 
 *    Each member of the $assoc_properties_array argument becomes an object property.
 *    (wheather the property was already defined in the object or not).
 * 
 *    The $assoc_properties_array defines the order which the values array 
 *    values correlate to an object property. 
 *
 *
 * PHP version >=5.6
